# Replication Log

The Replicated Log should have the following deployment architecture: one Master and any number of Secondaries.

Master should expose a simple HTTP server (or alternative service with a similar API) with: 
- POST method - appends a message into the in-memory list
- GET method - returns all messages from the in-memory list

Secondary should expose a simple  HTTP server(or alternative service with a similar API)  with:
- GET method - returns all replicated messages from the in-memory list

## First iteration

Properties and assumptions:
 - after each POST request, the message should be replicated on every Secondary server 
 - Master should ensure that Secondaries have received a message via ACK 
 - Masterâ€™s POST request should be finished only after receiving ACKs from all Secondaries (blocking replication approach)
 - to test that the replication is blocking, introduce the delay/sleep on the Secondary
 - at this stage assume that the communication channel is a perfect link (no failures and messages lost)
 - implementation support logging 
 - Master and Secondaries run in Docker

### Project structure
 - `master/` - folder for Master node;
 - `slave_1/` - folder for Secondary 1 node;
 - `slave_2/` - folder for Secondary 2 node;

### Run command
 - `docker-compose up`
